# CVE List - XML and Python Parsing Project

### Overview 

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to store, transform, and parse structured data about CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) using XML, and Python.
This project utilizes XML to store and organize a list of CVEs as well as a Python script to parse and extract the CVE data.


### Technologies Used

- XML (Extensible Markup Language) for storing CVE data.

- Python for parsing XML and extracting the CVE information.

- Libraries: Pythonâ€™s built-in xml.etree.ElementTree module to parse the XML file.
  
### Features

  - XML Storage: The project uses XML format to represent CVE data in a structured way.

  - Python Parsing: A Python script is provided to parse through the XML file and print out CVE details in a tabular format.

  - Easy-to-Read Output: The Python script transforms the raw XML data into a more human-readable format.

## Files

- `cve_list.xml` : Contains the CVE data in XML format.
- `parse_cves.py` : Python script that parses the XML and prints the CVE details to the console.
