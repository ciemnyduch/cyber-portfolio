## Unauthenticated scan for Windows 10 Homelab Tutorial 

Virtual machines (VMs) used are provisioned with Azure services

### What you'll need to do for this lab:

win + r + wf.msc, and disable VM's firewall
Ensure your NSG within Azure also allows all traffic inbound

Ping the public IP of the VM from your local host to ensure it is accessible from the internet (This is just for the lab)
(If the ping isn't replying this is an indicator that the scan may not work)
